# Stock Analysis with VBA and Excel

##Overview of Project:
###Purpose of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to provide accurate stock data for 2017 and 2018 to allow for a decision making process to occur. The technical purpose of this project was to explore our use of VBA by editing and refactoring the stock market dataset with VBA to manipulate and produce reliable data to allow for a decision to be made on stock ROI. Finally, we added and subtracted code throughout the project to create efficiencies in the run time and improve overall logic in the code. 

##Results
The outputs for the 2017 and 2018 stock analysis ranged from overall very positive for selected tickers in 2017 and dismall overall performance in the 2018 fiscal year.

As you can see the 2017 stocks faired to a large extent very well when looking at overall ROI with the greatest return occuring with DQ. When looking at overall daily volume we can summize that all stocks presented are widely traded and faired well when comparing to overall ROI in 2017 for all stocks.
In 2018, we had much of the complete opposite. 2018 overall stocks selected performed poorly with the worst culprite being, DQ! DQ has quite the amount of volatility when comparing 2017 to 2018 therefore could hinder investor confidence.  

Finally, when looking at the run times for both 2017 and 2018 data sets we noticed the following:

Both run times were fairly similar!


##Summary
###Pros and Cons to refactoring:
When performing this challenge I noticed several disadvantages such as a complex unstructed code can lead to confusion with the producer of the code therefore it is best to maintain order within the code by allowing whitespace and frequent comments to allow a 3rd person with knowledge of the code to be able to pick it up and run with it. In addition, refactoring the code can lead to a negative effect on the testing outcomes.
Several advantages presented were that logical errors appear easliy in a well structured code that contains whitespace and appropriate comments throughout. ALlows the reader to understand where an If picks up and Ends as well as loops and nested loops.
Finally, the pros and cons are really structured around one specific thing: if the code is well maintained and orderly then that allows for easy interpretation and pick up which allows for the code to be used going forward. This is the most important lesson produced from this module.
